# Schematic

Schematic needs to be rebuilt first to run in a container locally easily. The latest container hosted in GHCR is missing run_app.py, so I add that in.

After you rebuild the image from this container, if you follow the instructions to gather the required environment variables, you can run the container with `docker compose up`
