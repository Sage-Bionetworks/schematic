Validate
========

Given a filled-out manifest:

- The manifest is validated against the JSON-LD schema as it maps to GX rules.
- A ``jsonschema`` is generated from the data model. The data model can be in CSV, JSON-LD format, as input formats are decoupled from the internal data model representation within Schematic.
- A set of validation rules is defined in the data model. Some validation rules are implemented via GX; others are custom Python code. All validation rules have the same interface.
- Certain GX rules require looping through all projects a user has access to, or a specified scope of projects, to find other projects with manifests.
- Validation results are provided before the manifest file is uploaded into Synapse.
